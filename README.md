# Givenergy Cloud service

This integration connects the GivEnergy cloud service to Home Assistant

* This alpha version only supports inverters and a few basic sensors

Enter the name of your account e.g. home (useful only if you have more than one) and the API key from the GE Cloud Accounts area.

If all is working then the integration will create some sensors and update them once a minute

For support please raise a Github ticket.
